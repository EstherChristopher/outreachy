# Introduction
Hello fellow contributorsüëãüèª, my names are Esther Christopher, (but you can a call me Nana) and I'm based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm a technical writer with particular interests in API documentation. I'm also a front-end developer.

Interestingly enough, I got into the initial application stage of Outreachy last year and guess what project I gravitated towards- ta-da Wagtail!
Unfortunately, Nigerian universities called off the strike just before the final application and all Nigerian students had to stop with the process.

As someone who loves everything documentation from how-to's to tutorials, and everything in between, it was a no-brainer to join the Wagtail project. I'm quite versed in writing documentation having written a couple of them and also familiar with contributing to open-source.

Knowing the importance of accessibility in software development, it piqued my interest that Wagtail was extending it to documentation so I knew I wanted to be part of the "Accessibility features documentation" project.

It's a delight to be here and I absolutely look forward to making acquaintance with other contributors as well as help each other when needed.
